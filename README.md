# NumberGuesser App

Windows console application written in C# / .NET - Simple number guessing game. This app is from the C# / .NET tutorial on YouTube by Brad Traversy

Forked by JasonBrownell

I viewed Brad's YouTube video tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcFJjpMFJvI], where he developed this code. I forked the code base for this so I'll have a template/inspiration for any simple Visual C# app I create in the future.

Especially of interest to me is Visual C# Console Application Tooling, and it's use of multi-colored, terminal output with little overhead.

### Version
1.0.1

## Usage
Run bin/NumberGuesser.exe
